The Program :

#include <stdio.h>

int main()

F *f;
int lines_n=0;

char filename[100],sample_;

printf("Enter file name");

scanf("%s" , filename);

F=fopen("%s" , filename , "r");


sample_chr = getc(fp);

    while (sample_!= EOF) {
    
        
        if (sample_ == '')
        {    
            
            ines_n=no_lines+1;
        }
        
        sample_= getc(F);
    }
    fclose(F); //close file.
    printf("There are %d lines in %s 
    ", no_lines, filename);
    return 0;
}
